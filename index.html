  <h1><p style="color: pink">6 Tips on How to Concentrate and Improve Your Brain’s Ability to Focus</h1>
  <h2><p style="color:gray">You start your day intent on being productive and accomplish everything you’ve planned on.
  You want to finish your homework, prepare a presentation, and end up with some time to hit the gym or grab a few drinks with your friends. 
  And yet, you spend what seems like just a few minutes scrolling through Facebook, checking chat notifications, and watching funny cat videos.
  Time flies and, before you know it, you’ve wasted a good chunk of your day on meaningless stuff. Sounds familiar?</h2>
  <h2><p style="color: turquoise"> We all have to deal with countless distractions and productivity issues.
  Luckily, there are ways to improve your focus and concentration to finally be proud of what you’ve achieved today</h2>
  <h1><p style="color: pink">Want to Learn How to Stay Focused? Start With Building Your Concentration Muscles</h1>
  <h2><p style="color:gray">So what can you do when you need to hunker down and really focus on the task at hand?
  Some people mistakenly believe that they just lack focus so they quit easy, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy.
  Many psychologists, coaches, and tutors, such as Elie Venezky, the author of Hack Your Brain, suggest that focus or concentration can be compared to a muscle. 
  Turns out, your ability to focus can be noticeably improved, but it takes time and commitment.
  Before starting, you should keep in mind that your ability to concentrate is not limitless, and it’s also very individual.
  While some people can learn how to get in the zone pretty easily, for others it might be a longer and harder battle (people with ADHD, we feel you!).
  So, remember to give yourself time and don’t be too hard on yourself if for some time it feels like you don’t make any progress.
  If you dedicate yourself to working on your concentration and attention, after some time you’ll notice that it is easier for you to stay focused
  , and your productivity will change for the better as well!</h2>
  <h1><p style="color: turquoise"> 10 Science-Backed Tips on How to Stay Focused for Longer
  1. Play Brain Training Games</h1>
  <h1><p style="color:gray">Here are just some ideas of the brain training games to try:</h1>
  <h2><p style="color: turquoise">
  Sudoku
  Crosswords
  Chess
  Word search
  Jigsaw puzzles
  Bridge
  Scrabble</h2>
  <h1><p style="color: pink">2. Listen to Music You Like</h1>
  <h2><p style="color:gray">A study from the University of North Carolina and Wake Forest School of Medicine showed that listening to music you like can improve your concentration. 
  The keyword here is “like,” which perhaps explains why listening to your neighbor belt out their favorite karaoke songs doesn’t help your concentration at all.  
  While the study doesn’t require a specific genre—only that you listen to songs you like— an article published at Psychomusicology:
  Music, Mind, and Brain, suggests that low arousal, negative impact music like Chopin’s Prelude in E Minor improves concentration while studying.
  We know that not everyone will be happy to listen to Chopin eight hours a day, so don’t torture yourself and go for the playlist you love instead.</h2>
  <h1><p style="color: turquoise">3. Remember to Take Breaks</h1>
  <h1><p style="color: pink">You can’t expect yourself to be 100% focused all the time.
  Adding breaks to your routine will help you fight distraction and build your concentration and attention span at the same time.
  If you find yourself checking your email or Instagram constantly, make a pact with yourself and start with short,
  focused bursts of work first. The Pomodoro Technique is perfect for this approach.</h1>
  <h1><p style="color:gray">Here’s how the Pomodoro Technique works:  </h1>
  <h2><p style="color: turquoise"> Select a task that needs your undivided attention. Keep your gadgets away (preferably on mute). 
  Set a timer for 25 minutes and start working. No choosing the right playlist on Spotify or making yourself comfortable at your desk for ten minutes!
  If you feel the urge to take a break or check your phone, remind yourself that you will do it as soon as your timer runs out. 
  Take a 5-minute break after the 25 minute period is over.
  Repeat as necessary, taking a 15-minute break in between four 25-minute work bursts.
  The good thing about this technique is that it’s very adjustable. Some people find it easier to have longer work streaks or longer breaks — it all depends on your preferences.
  Start with the classic approach, and later you’ll see if you want to tweak it to make it even more beneficial.
  The most important part is to make yourself work without any distractions for a given period of time. As you might have guessed, it might not feel like a piece of cake at first.
  But, if you try your best to stick to working during the given period of time, it will improve not only your concentration but also your willpower. And that’s a great bonus!</h2>
  <h1><p style="color: pink">4. Create a “Do Later List” </h1>
  <h2><p style="color:gray">Imagine a scenario when you actually work rather productively and happy with everything you’ve done so far for the last half an hour.
  And then, a random idea, errand, or question pops into your head out of nowhere.
  “When is the next Star Wars movie coming out?”
  “I have to buy milk and coffee!”
  “Should I have sushi or burger for dinner?”
  Of course, you cannot simply stop those thoughts from appearing and, actually, you shouldn’t. Sometimes, these “out-of-nowhere” thoughts might result in creative solutions. 
  What you should do is try to unload your brain and consciously point it back in the right direction.
  The main problem with this kind of thoughts is that it is extremely difficult to let them go, as you’re subconsciously worried that you will not remember them later.
  So, you end up trying to keep them in your mind for as long as possible, which causes distraction and overload for your brain.
  Instead of spending your precious time and attention on random thoughts when you’re being productive, simply write them down and get back to your main task. 
  The mechanism is simple — as soon as you get them written down, you won’t be worried about forgetting them.
  And, come back to this list after you’re done with your main task or have a break during practicing the Pomodoro Technique. </h2>
  <h1><p style="color: turquoise">5. Minimize Electronic Distractions </h1>
  <h1><p style="color: pink">You can’t learn how to improve concentration if you’re constantly checking your phone throughout the day.
  Even if you’re only checking work emails or your employer’s Slack feed,
  multitasking and switching your attention from one assignment to another isn’t good for you and your attention muscles. 
  The best solution is to put it away or turn off the notifications at least for a certain time when you have to stay focused.
  Switching to something else while in the middle of a task jumbles your brain’s concentration. 
  Instead of focusing on what you’re doing now, your brain is still thinking about the task you were doing before.
  Sophie Leroy, a professor at UW Bothell School of Business, calls this phenomenon “attention residue.”
  We know that it might be especially difficult to focus when you’re a knowledge worker who has a laptop connected to Wi-Fi all day.
  If the Pomodoro Technique isn’t enough, install website or app blockers on your laptop or phone to block everything that’s not related to your task. </h1>
  <h1><p style="color:gray">6. Doodle </h1>
  <h2><p style="color: turquoise">Surprisingly, it turns out doodling during long meetings or calls isn’t so bad after all. 
  A study conducted by Jackie Andrade from the University of Plymouth School of Psychology showed that people who doodle during calls 
  or meetings have better memory recollection and concentration.
  Andrade explains that doodling, the act of drawing or coloring random images, keeps the brain’s arousal at an optimal level.
  In short, it keeps you alert when you’re bored.  Not only it helps you to focus and boost concentration — doodling also helps in memory retention and even reduces stress!
  Don’t be afraid to doodle next time you’re in a meeting. It’s certainly better than getting caught sleeping.  </h2>
  <h1><p style="color: pink">Know How to Concentrate Fully, But Know When to Stop, Too</h1>
  <h2><p style="color:gray"> Hopefully, this article armed you with different things you can try to boost your concentration and increase your attention span.
  With practice, you’ll find it easier to get in the zone next time you need to do something important.
  To recap:
  Play brain training games
  Listen to your favorite tunes
  Schedule breaks throughout the day 
  Create a do-later list
  Read long-form content
  Turn off notifications and other online distractions
  Embrace boredom
  Don’t be afraid to doodle
  Meditate and practice mindfulness
  Find out why you’re distracted in the first place
  All things said, it’s also important to know when to stop. 
  The internet and the technological advancements available now make it easier to work around the clock, but that doesn’t mean you should. 
  Having a good sleep, quality rest, and knowing how to shift your focus to things that make you happy go a long way!
  Not only these simple things will make your life more full and enjoyable — they also have a direct connection to your productivity. </h2>
